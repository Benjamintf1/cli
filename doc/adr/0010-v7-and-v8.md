# 10. Synchronizing V7 and V8 (Master) code

Date: 2020-06-04

## Status

## Context

_The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision._

Changes committed to the [V7
branch](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/tree/v7) need to be cherry-picked
onto the [master (V8) branch](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli), a manual
process.

This is the process that Ops Manager follows to maintain several branches. For
example, when I was on the Ops Manager team, I would patch the 2.6 branch, merge
2.6 to 2.7, merge 2.7 to 2.8, merge 2.8 to 2.9.

## Decision

_The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement._

Commit changes on the V7 branch then merge to master/V8, e.g.:

```bash
git co V7
git pull -r
 # make changes
make
git add -p
git ci
git co master
git merge V7
make
git push
```

## Consequences

_What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated._

If a pair forgets to merge their commit to master, the subsequent merge to
master will pick up that change.

Sometimes a merge conflict will occur.

The first merge will be a doozy.
